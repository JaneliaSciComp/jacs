    	         samples. If there are fly lines which are not represented by a Fly Line Entity, it creates a
    	         new Fly Line Entity to cover the sample. It also makes sure that each Fly Line has the matching
    	         Fly Screen Samples as children.

    	         It produces as output a list of Fly Line groups, where the size of each group is an input parameter.
    	         The intention is that each group is then processable as a unit downstream. -->
