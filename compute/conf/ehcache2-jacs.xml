CacheManager Configuration
==========================
An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.

See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446. Another example, useful for Terracotta
server based deployments is <terracottaConfig url="${serverAndPort}"/ and specify a command line
switch of -Dserver36:9510

The attributes of <ehcache> are:
* name - an optional name for the CacheManager.  The name is optional and primarily used
for documentation or to distinguish Terracotta clustered cache state.  With Terracotta
clustered caches, a combination of CacheManager name and cache name uniquely identify a
particular cache store in the Terracotta clustered memory.
* updateCheck - an optional boolean flag specifying whether this CacheManager should check
for new versions of Ehcache over the Internet.  If not specified, updateCheck="true".
* dynamicConfig - an optional setting that can be used to disable dynamic configuration of caches
associated with this CacheManager.  By default this is set to true - i.e. dynamic configuration
is enabled.  Dynamically configurable caches can have their TTI, TTL and maximum disk and
in-memory capacity changed at runtime through the cache's configuration object.
* monitoring - an optional setting that determines whether the CacheManager should
automatically register the SampledCacheMBean with the system MBean server.

Currently, this monitoring is only useful when using Terracotta clustering and using the
Terracotta Developer Console. With the "autodetect" value, the presence of Terracotta clustering
will be detected and monitoring, via the Developer Console, will be enabled. Other allowed values
are "on" and "off".  The default is "autodetect". This setting does not perform any function when
used with JMX monitors.

* maxBytesLocalHeap - optional setting that constraints the memory usage of the Caches managed by the CacheManager
to use at most the specified number of bytes of the local VM's heap.
* maxBytesLocalOffHeap - optional setting that constraints the offHeap usage of the Caches managed by the CacheManager
to use at most the specified number of bytes of the local VM's offHeap memory.
* maxBytesLocalDisk - optional setting that constraints the disk usage of the Caches managed by the CacheManager
to use at most the specified number of bytes of the local disk.

These settings let you define "resource pools", caches will share. For instance setting maxBytesLocalHeap to 100M, will result in
all caches sharing 100 MegaBytes of ram. The CacheManager will balance these 100 MB across all caches based on their respective usage
patterns. You can allocate a precise amount of bytes to a particular cache by setting the appropriate maxBytes* attribute for that cache.
That amount will be subtracted from the CacheManager pools, so that if a cache a specified 30M requirement, the other caches will share
the remaining 70M.

Also, specifying a maxBytesLocalOffHeap at the CacheManager level will result in overflowToOffHeap to be true by default. If you don't want
a specific cache to overflow to off heap, you'll have to set overflowToOffHeap="false" explicitly

Here is an example of CacheManager level resource tuning, which will use up to 400M of heap and 2G of offHeap:

<ehcache xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ehcache.xsd"
         updateCheck="true" monitoring="autodetect"
         dynamicConfig="true" maxBytesLocalHeap="400M" maxBytesLocalOffHeap="2G">

-->
<ehcache xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ehcache.xsd"
         updateCheck="true" monitoring="autodetect"
         dynamicConfig="true" name="jacsCompute">

    <!--
    DiskStore configuration
    =======================

    The diskStore element is optional. To turn off disk store path creation, comment out the diskStore
    element below.

    Configure it if you have overflowToDisk or diskPersistent enabled for any cache.

    If it is not configured, and a cache is created which requires a disk store, a warning will be
     issued and java.io.tmpdir will automatically be used.

    diskStore has only one attribute - "path". It is the path to the directory where
    .data and .index files will be created.

    If the path is one of the following Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM. For backward compatibility these should be specified without being enclosed in the ${token}
    replacement syntax.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path
    * ehcache.disk.store.dir - A system property you would normally specify on the command line
      e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one

    -->
    <diskStore path="/opt/data/jacsCache"/>

    <!--
    TransactionManagerLookup configuration
    ======================================
    This class is used by ehcache to lookup the JTA TransactionManager use in the application
    using an XA enabled ehcache. If no class is specified then DefaultTransactionManagerLookup
    will find the TransactionManager in the following order

     *GenericJNDI (i.e. jboss, where the property jndiName controls the name of the
                    TransactionManager object to look up)
     *Bitronix
     *Atomikos

    You can provide you own lookup class that implements the
    net.sf.ehcache.transaction.manager.TransactionManagerLookup interface.
    -->

    <transactionManagerLookup class="net.sf.ehcache.transaction.manager.DefaultTransactionManagerLookup"
                              properties="jndiName=java:/TransactionManager" propertySeparator=";"/>


    <!--
    CacheManagerEventListener
    =========================
    Specifies a CacheManagerEventListenerFactory which is notified when Caches are added
    or removed from the CacheManager.

    The attributes of CacheManagerEventListenerFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Sets the fully qualified class name to be registered as the CacheManager event listener.

    The events include:
    * adding a Cache
    * removing a Cache

    Callbacks to listener methods are synchronous and unsynchronized. It is the responsibility
    of the implementer to safely handle the potential performance and thread safety issues
    depending on what their listener is doing.

    If no class is specified, no listener is created. There is no default.
    -->
    <cacheManagerEventListenerFactory class="" properties=""/>


    <!--
    CacheManagerPeerProvider
    ========================
    (For distributed operation)

    Specifies a CacheManagerPeerProviderFactory which will be used to create a
    CacheManagerPeerProvider, which discovers other CacheManagers in the cluster.

    One or more providers can be configured. The first one in the ehcache.xml is the default, which is used
    for replication and bootstrapping.

    The attributes of cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory are:
    * class - a fully qualified factory class name
    * properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Providers are available for RMI, JGroups and JMS as shown following.

    RMICacheManagerPeerProvider
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system with two means of discovery of
    CacheManager peers participating in the cluster:
    * automatic, using a multicast group. This one automatically discovers peers and detects
      changes such as peers entering and leaving the group
    * manual, using manual rmiURL configuration. A hardcoded list of peers is provided at
      configuration time.

    Configuring Automatic Discovery:
    Automatic discovery is configured as per the following example:
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
                        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                        properties="hostName=fully_qualified_hostname_or_ip,
                                    peerDiscovery=automatic, multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1,
                                    multicastGroupPort=4446, timeToLive=32"/>

    Valid properties are:
    * peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "automatic"
    * multicastGroupAddress (mandatory) - specify a valid multicast group address
    * multicastGroupPort (mandatory) - specify a dedicated port for the multicast heartbeat
      traffic
    * timeToLive - specify a value between 0 and 255 which determines how far the packets will
      propagate.

      By convention, the restrictions are:
      0   - the same host
      1   - the same subnet
      32  - the same site
      64  - the same region
      128 - the same continent
      255 - unrestricted

     * hostName - the hostname or IP of the interface to be used for sending and receiving multicast
       packets (relevant to multi-homed hosts only)

    Configuring Manual Discovery:
    Manual discovery requires a unique configuration per host. It is contains a list of rmiURLs for
    the peers, other than itself. So, if we have server1, server2 and server3 the configuration will
    be:

    In server1's configuration:
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class=
                          "net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                          properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                          rmiUrls=//server2:40000/sampleCache1|//server3:40000/sampleCache1
                          | //server2:40000/sampleCache2|//server3:40000/sampleCache2"
                          propertySeparator="," />

    In server2's configuration:
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class=
                          "net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                          properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                          rmiUrls=//server1:40000/sampleCache1|//server3:40000/sampleCache1
                          | //server1:40000/sampleCache2|//server3:40000/sampleCache2"
                          propertySeparator="," />

    In server3's configuration:
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory class=
                          "net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
                          properties="peerDiscovery=manual,
                          rmiUrls=//server1:40000/sampleCache1|//server2:40000/sampleCache1
                          | //server1:40000/sampleCache2|//server2:40000/sampleCache2"
                          propertySeparator="," />


    Valid properties are:
    * peerDiscovery (mandatory) - specify "manual"
    * rmiUrls (mandatory) - specify a pipe separated list of rmiUrls, in the form
                            //hostname:port
    * hostname (optional) - the hostname is the hostname of the remote CacheManager peer. The port is the listening
      port of the RMICacheManagerPeerListener of the remote CacheManager peer.

    JGroupsCacheManagerPeerProvider
    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
         class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jgroups.JGroupsCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
         properties="channel=ehcache^connect=UDP(mcast_addr=231.12.21.132;mcast_port=45566;ip_ttl=32;
         mcast_send_buf_size=150000;mcast_recv_buf_size=80000):
         PING(timeout=2000;num_initial_members=6):
         MERGE2(min_interval=5000;max_interval=10000):
         FD_SOCK:VERIFY_SUSPECT(timeout=1500):
         pbcast.NAKACK(gc_lag=10;retransmit_timeout=3000):
         UNICAST(timeout=5000):
         pbcast.STABLE(desired_avg_gossip=20000):
         FRAG:
         pbcast.GMS(join_timeout=5000;join_retry_timeout=2000;shun=false;print_local_addr=false)"
         propertySeparator="^"
     />
     JGroups configuration is done by providing a connect string using connect= as in the above example which uses
     multicast, or since version 1.4, a file= to specify the location of a JGroups configuration file.

     If neither a connect or file property is specified, the default JGroups JChannel will be used.

     Multiple JGroups clusters may be run on the same network by specifying a different CacheManager name. The name
     is used as the cluster name.

     Since version 1.4 you can specify a channelName to avoid conflicts.


    JMSCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    <cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
            class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jms.JMSCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
            properties="..."
            propertySeparator=","
            />

    The JMS PeerProviderFactory uses JNDI to maintain message queue independence. Refer to the manual for full configuration
    examples using ActiveMQ and Open Message Queue.

    Valid properties are:
    * initialContextFactoryName (mandatory) - the name of the factory used to create the message queue initial context.
    * providerURL (mandatory) - the JNDI configuration information for the service provider to use.
    * topicConnectionFactoryBindingName (mandatory) - the JNDI binding name for the TopicConnectionFactory
    * topicBindingName (mandatory) - the JNDI binding name for the topic name
    * getQueueBindingName (mandatory only if using jmsCacheLoader) - the JNDI binding name for the queue name
    * securityPrincipalName - the JNDI java.naming.security.principal
    * securityCredentials - the JNDI java.naming.security.credentials
    * urlPkgPrefixes - the JNDI java.naming.factory.url.pkgs
    * userName - the user name to use when creating the TopicConnection to the Message Queue
    * password - the password to use when creating the TopicConnection to the Message Queue
    * acknowledgementMode - the JMS Acknowledgement mode for both publisher and subscriber. The available choices are
                            AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE, DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE and SESSION_TRANSACTED. The default is AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE.

            properties="peerDiscovery=automatic,
                        multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1,
                        multicastGroupPort=4446, timeToLive=1"
            propertySeparator=","
            />


    <!--
    CacheManagerPeerListener
    ========================
    (Enable for distributed operation)

    Specifies a CacheManagerPeerListenerFactory which will be used to create a
    CacheManagerPeerListener, which listens for messages from cache replicators participating in the cluster.

    The attributes of cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory are:
    class - a fully qualified factory class name
    properties - comma separated properties having meaning only to the factory.

    Ehcache comes with a built-in RMI-based distribution system. The listener component is
    RMICacheManagerPeerListener which is configured using
    RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory. It is configured as per the following example:

    <cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory
        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"
        properties="hostName=fully_qualified_hostname_or_ip,
                    port=40001,
                    remoteObjectPort=40002,
                    socketTimeoutMillis=120000"
                    propertySeparator="," />

    All properties are optional. They are:
    * hostName - the hostName of the host the listener is running on. Specify
      where the host is multihomed and you want to control the interface over which cluster
      messages are received. Defaults to the host name of the default interface if not
      specified.
    * port - the port the RMI Registry listener listens on. This defaults to a free port if not specified.
    * remoteObjectPort - the port number on which the remote objects bound in the registry receive calls.
                         This defaults to a free port if not specified.
    * socketTimeoutMillis - the number of ms client sockets will stay open when sending
      messages to the listener. This should be long enough for the slowest message.
      If not specified it defaults to 120000ms.

            class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"/>

    <!--
    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxEntriesLocalHeap:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory.  0 = no limit.
    In practice no limit means Integer.MAX_SIZE (2147483647) unless the cache is distributed
    with a Terracotta server in which case it is limited by resources.

    maxEntriesLocalDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
    The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    overflowToOffHeap:
    (boolean) This feature is available only in enterprise versions of Ehcache.
    When set to true, enables the cache to utilize off-heap memory
    storage to improve performance. Off-heap memory is not subject to Java
    GC. The default value is false.

    maxBytesLocalHeap:
    Defines how many bytes the cache may use from the VM's heap. If a CacheManager
    maxBytesLocalHeap has been defined, this Cache's specified amount will be
    subtracted from the CacheManager. Other caches will share the remainder.
    This attribute's values are given as <number>k|K|m|M|g|G for
    kilobytes (k|K), megabytes (m|M), or gigabytes (g|G).
    For example, maxMemoryOffHeap="2g" allots 2 gigabytes to off-heap memory.
    If you specify a maxBytesLocalHeap, you can't use the maxEntriesLocalHeap attribute.
    maxEntriesLocalHeap can't be used if a CacheManager maxBytesLocalHeap is set.

    Elements put into the cache will be measured in size using net.sf.ehcache.pool.sizeof.SizeOf
    If you wish to ignore some part of the object graph, see net.sf.ehcache.pool.sizeof.annotations.IgnoreSizeOf

    maxBytesLocalOffHeap:
    This feature is available only in enterprise versions of Ehcache.
    Sets the amount of off-heap memory this cache can use, and will reserve.

    This setting will set overflowToOffHeap to true. Set explicitly to false to disable overflow behavior.

    Note that it is recommended to set maxEntriesLocalHeap to at least 100 elements
    when using an off-heap store, otherwise performance will be seriously degraded,
    and a warning will be logged.

    The minimum amount that can be allocated is 128MB. There is no maximum.

    maxBytesLocalDisk:
    As for maxBytesLocalHeap, but specifies the limit of disk storage this cache will ever use.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    statistics:
    Whether to collect statistics. Note that this should be turned on if you are using
    the Ehcache Monitor. By default statistics is turned off to favour raw performance.
    To enable set statistics="true"

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxEntriesLocalHeap limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    copyOnRead:
    Whether an Element is copied when being read from a cache.
    By default this is false.

    copyOnWrite:
    Whether an Element is copied when being added to the cache.
    By default this is false.
