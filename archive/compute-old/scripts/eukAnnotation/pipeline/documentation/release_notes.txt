Release 0.32
------------
Sorting of large blast results has been reworked to decrease memory requirements and
improve error handling.

A new script has been added: clearVICSStorage.pl.  This script can be used by the
VICS support staff to clear the VICS filestore and database of content associated with
a compute set.

The computeStats.pl script's estimate of CPU usage by overhead processing (sorting/loading
results) has been improved by incorporating statistics from past runs.

The startViralPipeline.pl script has been modified to automatically implement
the "four part ENV_NT" workaround.

Release 0.31
------------
A new script has been added to release 0.31 to simplify execution of the
Viral MG Pipeline.

     $ /computemodule/startViralPipeline.pl -F fastafile -P projectcode -t "taglist"
 
Release 0.31 also implements calculation of Pvalue for blast results
(previously this value was set to -1).  Pvalue is calculated by the formula:

                                           -Evalue
                      Pvalue    =    1 - e

Script fixPvalue.pl has been provided to back-update existing results:

     $ /computemodule/fixPvalue.pl -D mycomputes.db
     Pvalue updated.


Release 0.3
-----------
This release was primarily made to accomodate changes to the VICS services.
One new module has been added to display the CPU time used by the computes
(computeStats.pl).  If you encounter any problems please contact Erin Beck
or Jeff Hoover.

Release 0.2
-----------
This is the initial release of the compute module.  The module has been
thoroughly tested, but as with any complex piece of software, some bugs may
(and likely do) exist.  If you encounter any problems please contact Jeff
Hoover.

Several issues from the beta release have been addressed in this release
- loading of blast results has been rewritten to lower memory demands and
  speed-up performance
- blast rank_vs_query and rank_vs_subject now rank the entire hit, rather
  than separately ranking each hsp
- num_gaps has been added to the blast results
- result views compute_btab_jcvi and compute_btab_ncbi have been added
- several minor bugs have been corrected in refreshDataset.pl
- an option has been added to importHmmDB.pl, to allow inclusion of private
  hmm annotations 
- corrected errors in the size calculations for rpsblast databases
