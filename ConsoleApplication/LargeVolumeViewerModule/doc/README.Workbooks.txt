NOTE:
The Workbooks directory here, will hold workbooks created using Tableau.  In order for Tableau to function, it must have its full workspace established.  Said workspace will
include not only the Workbooks, but also ./Shapes, ./Logs, and ./Datasources.  These latter three have been kept out of the source code repository, because the add clutter, and
because they should actually remain the same across all runs of Tableau.  That is, nothing unique here.

Therefore, in order to use any workbooks found here, you will need to let Tableau create its workspace in this "./doc" directory, 'around' the Workbooks directory.

Caution: to avoid re-cluttering, always inform git to ignore ./Shapes, ./Logs and ./Datasources.
