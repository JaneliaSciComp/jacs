To read ".asta" files, you may download the free (community) version of Astah UML, from http://astah.net/download .  At time of writing, no special features appear in this .asta document, which cannot be understood by the community version.
If that fails, or if you find you do not wish to walk through the software, please contact Les Foster (fosterl@janelia.hhmi.org) for ".png" dumps of all diagrams.
